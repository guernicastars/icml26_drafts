# Baseline Project Guidelines

## MCP Tools

### Context7 - MUST USE
**When to use**:
- Always when looking up library documentation
- When troubleshooting library-specific issues
- Before implementing features with external dependencies

**How to use**:
1. `mcp__context7__resolve-library-id` - Find the library ID
2. `mcp__context7__get-library-docs` - Get documentation with the ID from step 1

**Why**: Ensures current, accurate documentation rather than outdated knowledge.

## Dev Experts Agents - USE PROACTIVELY

**Always use these agents when the task matches:**

| Agent | Trigger |
|-------|---------|
| `dev-experts:reviewer` | Before ANY commit/PR, or when reviewing code changes |
| `dev-experts:tester` | When writing or updating tests |
| `dev-experts:architect` | When planning new features or significant changes |
| `dev-experts:python-dev` | When writing/reviewing Python code |
| `dev-experts:rust-dev` | When writing/reviewing Rust code |
| `dev-experts:cpp-dev` | When writing/reviewing C++ code |
| `dev-experts:devops` | When debugging production/infrastructure issues |

**How**: Use the Task tool with `subagent_type="dev-experts:<agent-name>"`

## Skills - USE WHEN APPLICABLE

| Skill | When to Use | How to Invoke |
|-------|-------------|---------------|
| `datetime` | Need current date/time for logging, file naming, timestamps, APIs | `/datetime` or use `date` commands from skill |
| `tmux` | Interactive programs: REPLs, debuggers, dev servers, parallel tasks | `/tmux` - use `tmux-ctl` commands |
| `anti-ai-slop` | After and before writing code, before commit - clean up AI-generated bloat and prevent new one | `/anti-ai-slop` |
| `prompt-improver` | Auto-triggered on vague prompts to ask clarifying questions | Automatic via hook |

### Project Skills (`.claude/skills/`)

| Skill | When to Use |
|-------|-------------|
| `ml-paper-writing` | Any paper writing task: drafting sections, structuring arguments, citations. Templates at `.claude/skills/ml-paper-writing/templates/icml2026/`. Use proactively without being asked. |
| `academic-plotting` | Any figure request. Data plots (loss, bar, ablation) via matplotlib; architecture/pipeline diagrams via Gemini. |
| `presenting-conference-talks` | Converting the paper to slides: generates Beamer PDF + PPTX with speaker notes. |
| `systems-paper-writing` | OSDI/SOSP/ASPLOS/NSDI only. Not relevant for ICML26. |

### AI Research Skills Library (`.claude/skills/ai-research-skills/`)

85 skills for the full research lifecycle. Relevant categories:

| Category | Path |
|----------|------|
| Post-Training / MARL / RL | `06-post-training/` |
| Agents | `14-agents/` |
| Evaluation | `11-evaluation/` |
| Distributed Training | `08-distributed-training/` |
| Research Ideation | `21-research-ideation/` |
| ML Paper Writing | `20-ml-paper-writing/` |

### Quick Skill Reference

**datetime**: `date +%Y-%m-%d`, `date +%s` (epoch), `date -u +"%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%SZ"` (ISO UTC)

**tmux**:
- `tmux-ctl eval "command"` - one-off execution
- `tmux-ctl repl python "expr"` - REPL one-shot
- `tmux-ctl start "npm run dev" --name=server` - background process
- `tmux-ctl logs server` - view output

**anti-ai-slop**: Removes unnecessary comments, redundant checks, single-use variables, style drift from branch diff

## Code Quality

### Comments
**Only write comments for**:
- Complex algorithms that aren't immediately obvious
- Non-obvious workarounds for known issues/bugs
- Critical "why" explanations that code cannot express

**99% of code should be self-explanatory through**:
- Clear, descriptive naming
- Proper structure and organization
- Following language best practices

## Git Workflow

### Commit Messages
Use **Conventional Commits** format:
- `feat:` - New features
- `fix:` - Bug fixes
- `refactor:` - Code refactoring
- `docs:` - Documentation changes
- `test:` - Test updates
- `chore:` - Maintenance tasks

Example: `feat: add user authentication system`

### Branch Naming
Use **type prefixes**:
- `feature/` - New features
- `fix/` - Bug fixes
- `refactor/` - Code refactoring

Example: `feature/user-authentication`

## Engineering Philosophy

### Approach
- **Pragmatic over perfect** - Ship working solutions, iterate if needed
- **Question assumptions** - Always ask clarifying questions before building
- **YAGNI** - Don't over-engineer; build what's needed now
- **KISS** - Prefer simple solutions over complex ones

### Communication Style
- **Ask questions** when requirements are unclear or ambiguous
- **Brainstorm ideas** - discuss different approaches
- **Find optimal approach** - balance simplicity, maintainability, and effectiveness
- **Avoid over-engineering** - question if complexity is truly necessary
- **Be concise** - get to the point, focus on solutions

## Testing
- Tests will be specified when needed
- Don't assume - ask if testing is required

## Library / Framework First Assumption

Unless explicitly stated otherwise, **always assume that we are building a library or framework, not an application or script**.

This implies the following non-negotiable rules:

* The user **cannot modify library source code or directories**
* The user **cannot add files, types, or logic inside the library**
* All customization must happen **outside the library**, via:

  * dependency injection
  * composition
  * traits / interfaces
  * callbacks or configuration objects

A design is **invalid** if:

* extending behavior requires editing library files
* new user-defined concepts require adding enum values
* functionality is centralized in “registry” files that must be modified

The library must be:

* open for extension
* closed for modification
* usable in unknown future contexts

Configuration rules:

* everything that can be configured **must be configurable**
* defaults are allowed, hard-coded decisions are not
* CLI arguments are adapters, **not core configuration**

Script vs library separation:

* core logic must live in reusable library functions/classes
* scripts must only parse arguments, call the library, and serialize results

When in doubt, **prefer designs that maximize user freedom and long-term extensibility**, even at the cost of slightly higher initial complexity.
